A technique of finding the top co-liked individuals/products/services.
Example: A set of people like John. That same set also likes me. As such, it is probable that John and myself have some things in common.
The same is true of products. If a set of people like product X, and also like Z, it is probable that X and Z have some things in common.
We say that X and Z, or John and myself, are "co-liked".

Product Recommendations

Approach:
1. Find the set of people Y who like person/product X
2. Find other persons/products Z who are liked by someone in group Y
3. Rank members of Z according to how many times they're liked by Y

Example:
John, Amy, Bob and Joe like Peet's Coffee
John, Bob and Joe like Lillie's Chocolate
John and Bob like The Tea Spot
Amy and Joe like So Delicious Coconut Creamer
Peet's Coffee, Lillies Chocolate, The Tea Spot and So Delicious Coconut Creamer are all "co-liked"
